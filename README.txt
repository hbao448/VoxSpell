1. Introduction
This program is intended for use by children of age 7-10 as a spelling aid game.

2. Prerequisites
The following packages are required to run this program:
	Festival
	VLC
	FFmpeg
	Java Version 8
For detailed instructions on how to install these packages please go to section 2.1 of the user manual.

3. Starting the program
To start the program, navigate to the directory that the VoxSpell.jar file and Resources folder is located in using the terminal, then call:
	java -jar VoxSpell.jar
This call will only work if the default java version is above 1.8.

In order to make the program work if java 1.8 is not the default version, please go to /usr/lib/jvm/ and find a jdk whose version is over 1.8
Then proceed to the bin folder of the jdk and copy the classpath of the "java" program, then navigate back to the VoxSpell directory and call the whole java classpath instead, for example:
	/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_91/bin/java -jar VoxSpell.jar
The program should now start.

For detailed information about using the program please read the user manual.
